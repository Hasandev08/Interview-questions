## 1- Three boxes labeled as red, blue and mixed.These labels are incorrect.one box contains red balls and another box contains blue balls and remaining one box contains both red and blue balls. Pickup one ball from any box(u should pickup ball only once) and name the correct labels.
- The boxes will be wrongly labeled as RR, BB, RB meaning all red, all blue and mix respectively. So as the labels are wrong we will first open the box having label of RB knowing that it is the label of the mixed box. As the label will is wrong so which ever colored ball we get that box will be of that color. Suppose if that box contains all the red balls then we will open the box labeled with BB which will containe random balls as red balls were already found and it can not have blue balls as the labels are not right, So the last box will definitely contain mix balls.

## 2- Cut the cake into 8 parts with only three cuts.
- First cut the cake in 4 pieces using two of the cuts so that only one cut remains.
- Now take all the four pieces in a stack and add a cut to divide the cake into 8 parts.

## 3- If you have 7 balls. One weighs more than the others (not significantly). You have a scale, like the scales of justice. How do you find the weighted ball only using the scale twice?
- Weigh 3 and 3. If the weight is equal then you are holding the heavier ball else if the weight is not equal take the 3 balls with greater weight and weigh any 2 balls if the weight is equal you are holding the heavier ball else the the heavier ball will be on the scale.

## 4- You have 12 black socks and 12 white socks in your drawer. What is the minimum number of socks that you have to take out to make sure that you have a matching pair? Room is dark, u cant see colours (consider urself blind).
- If the first is white and the second is black, the third would be either white or black, making a match with one of the first two.
- If the first is white and the second is white, there is a match.
- If the first is black and the second is black, there is a match.

## 5- A windowless room contains three identical light fixtures, each containing an identical light bulb or light globe. Each light is connected to one of three switches outside of the room. Each bulb is switched off at present. You are outside the room, and the door is closed. Before opening the door you may play around with the light switches as many times as you like. But once you've opened the door, you may no longer touch a switch. After this, you go into the room and examine the lights. How can you tell which switch goes to which light?
- Turn any two switches on and after a while turn any of them off and enter the room. The bulb on will be of the switch that is on, the bulb which will be a bit hotter will be of the switch that was turned off and the third bulb will be of the switch which was never turned on.

## 6- Two trains are on same track and they are coming toward each other. The speed of the first train is 50 km/h and the speed of the second train is 70 km/h. A bee starts flying between the trains when the distance between two trains is 100 km. The bee first flies from first train to second train. Once it reaches the second train, it immediately flies back to the first train and so on until trains collide. Calculate the total distance travelled by the bee. Speed of bee is 80 km/h

## 7- There are 100 doors in a row, all doors are initially closed. A person walks through all doors multiple times and toggle (if open then close, if close then open) them in the following way: In the first walk, the person toggles every door In the second walk, the person toggles every second door, i.e., 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, … In the third walk, the person toggles every third door, i.e. 3rd, 6th, 9th, … Likewise, In the 100th walk, the person toggles the 100th door.
- A door is toggled in an ith walk if i divide door number. For example, door number 45 is toggled in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 9th,15th, and 45th walks.
The door is switched back to an initial stage for every pair of divisors. For example, 45 is toggled 6 times for 3 pairs (5, 9), (15, 3), and (1, 45). 

It looks like all doors would become closed at the end. But there are door numbers that would open, for example, in 16, the divisors are (1,2,4,8,16) and as the pair(4,4) contributes only one divisor making the number of divisors odd, it would become open at the end. Similarly, all other perfect squares like 4, 9,…, and 100 would become open. Now, for prime numbers like 2,3,5,7… the divisors are (1, that number) and it is a pair, so they will remain closed at the end. And for all other numbers divisors are always in pairs, e.g. 15 = (1,15),(3,5), they will also remain closed.

So the answer is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 and 100.

## 8- There are 4 persons (A, B, C and D) who want to cross a bridge in night.
- A takes 1 minute to cross the bridge.
- B takes 2 minutes to cross the bridge.
- C takes 5 minutes to cross the bridge.
- D takes 8 minutes to cross the bridge.
- There is only one torch with them and the bridge cannot be crossed without the torch. There cannot be more than two persons on the bridge at any time, - and when two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person’s pace.

- Can they all cross the bridge in 15 minutes?

## 10- (Find ages of daughters) Alok has three daughters. His friend Shyam wants to know the ages of his daughters. Alok gives him first hint.
- The product of their ages is 72. Shyam says this is not enough information Alok gives him a second hint.
- The sum of their ages is equal to my house number. Shyam goes out and looks at the house number and tells “I still do not have enough information to determine the ages”. Alok admits that Shyam can not guess and gives him the third hint
- The oldest girl likes strawberry ice cream.

## 11- There are two mugs. One with 4 liters and the other with 5 liters capacity. How will you pour exactly 7 liters of water?
- Fill the 4 litre mug.
- Empty the 4 litre mug in 5 litre mug so that 5 litre mug has now 4 litre water.
- Refill the 4 litre mug.
- Again add water to the 5 litre mug, so that now it contains 5 litres of water whereas the 4 litre mug contains 3 litre water.
- Empty the 5 litre mug and add the water from 4 litre mug ti 5 litre mug so that the 5 litre mug now has 3 litre of water.
- Now fill the 4 litre mug so that in total there is 7 litre of water. 

## 12- You have 12 black socks and 12 white socks in your drawer. What is the minimum number of socks that you have to take out to make sure that you have a matching pair? Room is dark, u cant see colours
- 3 socks. Assume the first sock is black. The second one could be black, in which case you have a matching pair. If the second sock is white, the third sock will be either black and match the first sock, or white and match the second sock.

## 13- You have Two Jugs(Containers/Flasks), one of 3-litres and the other one of 5-litres. How would you exactly measure 4-litres considering you have excess supply of water
- Empty 3-litre bowl. Add 3-litres from 5-litre bowl to 3-litre bowl so that 2-litre water remains in the 5-litre bowl. Empty 3-litre bowl. Add remaining i.e., 2litres water from 5-litre bowl to 3-litre bowl so that it contains 2-litre bowl. Refill the 5-litre bowl and pour 1-litre from it to the 3-litre bowl so that 4-litre water remains in 5-litre bowl. 

## 14- How many times the minute hand and the hour hand of the clock meet each other in 12 hours consider both hands of the clock are initially at 12
- We know that the minute and hour hand coincide every 65 minutes and not 60 minutes.
Also, the hour and minute hand coincide only once between 11 and 1 o’clock i.e. at 12 o’clock.
So, from both the above statements we can say that the two hands coincide exactly 11 times in a 12 hour span

## 15- You have two identical ropes, one rope can burn in 60 mins, but burning pattern is irregular mean maybe first half of the rope can be burn in 50 mins and other half can be in 10 mins, you have to calculate 45 mins using the ropes.
- Burn rope#1 from both sides and rope 2 just from one side. The first rope will be burnt in 30 minutes as per the conditions.
At that time burn the rope 2 from the second side and after 15 minutes second rope will be burnt out and 
we have 45 minutes calculated

## 16- An airplane flies from Islamabad to Karachi in 90 mins but flies back from Karachi to Islamabad in 1 hour 30 minutes. Why?
- 90 mins = 1 hour 30 minutes

## 17- The longest distance you can travel when you have 3 motor bike tires that wear out after 30 km ?
There are 3 tyres i.e., 2 tyres attach to the bike and a stupny.
- First we will travel 15kms with the 2 already attached tyres.
- After 15kms we will change the rear tyre with the stupny and travel another 15kms.
- Then after 30kms we will change the front tyre which has already travelled 30kms and worn out with the tyre that has travelled only 15kms.
- After that we will be able to travel another 15kms so in total we were able to travel 45kms.
